## New and Noteworthy

### Grid Puchase Order

Grid Purchase Order is designed to share purchasing information between trade
partners. The purchase of goods and services is a primary activity within the
supply chain and the communication of order information occurs in various ways
today: by phone, email, SMS, eCommerce marketplaces, Electronic Data
Interchange (EDI), etc. Both the manual coordination and automated,
point-to-point sharing of purchasing information between trade partners present
challenges within day-to-day supply chain operations. Pain points include: poor
data accuracy stemming from manual data entry errors, discrepancies between
systems which impact receiving or result in financial claims, costs related to
administrative/clerical time, and management of custom integrations.

Grid Purchase Order aims to address these pain points by offering a common
industry solution for sharing purchase order information between trade partners
on Grid. Trade partners have the option to integrate this Grid component with
existing systems of record.
