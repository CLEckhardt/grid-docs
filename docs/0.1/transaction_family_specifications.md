Grid includes several transaction families to be used as a Sabre smart
contract, including Grid Schema, Pike, and Grid Track and Trace.

Each transaction family specification describes the available data objects,
state addressing (how transaction information is stored and addressed by
`namespace`), and the valid transactions: types, headers, payload format, and
execution rules.
