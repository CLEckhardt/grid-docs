A great way to contribute is by reporting issues. Before reporting an issue,
please review the current open issues to see if someone has already reported
the issue.

## Using Github Projects

Hyperledger Grid uses Github Projects as our issue tracking system:

<https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/projects/1>

## How to Report an Issue

Create issues in Github under the Hyperledger Grid project. If the issue is a
bug, please apply the 'bug' label to the issue.

When reporting an bug, please provide as much detail as possible about how to
reproduce it. If possible, explain how to reproduce the bug.  Details are very
helpful. Please include the following information:

* OS version
* Grid version
* Environment details (virtual, physical, etc.)
* Steps to reproduce the issue
* Actual results
* Expected results

If you would like, you could also describe the issue on RocketChat (see
[Joining the Discussion]({% link community/join_the_discussion.md %}))
for initial feedback before submitting the issue in Github.
