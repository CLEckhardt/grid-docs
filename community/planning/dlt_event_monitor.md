## Overview

The **DLT Event Monitor** is a utility that updates pending batches in Grid
with the latest information from the DLT. It does this by subscribing to the
DLTâ€™s subscription endpoint.

This is useful for two primary purposes:

 - Tracking whether the batch submitter needs to resubmit a batch
 - Allowing someone who submits a batch to be notified of the current batch
   status

## Input / Output Definition

The DLT polling monitor uses the following inputs:

 - `subscribe_stream` - Normalized stream sourced from Splinter or Sawtooth

And it modifies with the following:

 - `update_batch_statuses` - Updates the batch statuses in DB. In the future
   this may also perform other actions based on the status, such as a webhook
   request.

## Strategy

The DLT event monitor connects to the `subscribe_stream` via websocket. When a
known transaction id is received, we correlate that transaction id to the known
associated batch id, and `update_batch_statuses` as they are committed.

### Known limitations

This solution does not provide a method to determine whether a transaction has
failed in real time. The `subscribe_stream` will only send events that are
successful. Error events will need to come in via the [DLT Polling
Monitor](dlt_polling_monitor.md).
